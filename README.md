# Memory-Management-Simulation
n an operating system, each process has specific memory requirements.  These memory require-ments  are  met  (or  not)  based  on  whether  free  memory  is  available  to  fulfill  such  requirements.In this second project, you will simulate both contiguous and non-contiguous memory allocationschemes.  For contiguous memory allocation, you will implement a dynamic partitioning scheme.
